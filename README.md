## Exploring Data Augmentation and Active Learning Benefits in Imbalanced Datasets

This is the implementation of [Signal Processing, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing: Algorithms and Applications](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics/special_issues/9205L3Q93P) 2024 paper: <br>*Exploring Data Augmentation and Active Learning Benefits in Imbalanced Datasets*, which can be found in [Mathematics](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mathematics/special_issues/9205L3Q93P).

This work was developed to analyze the effect of different Data Augmentation and Active Learning techniques on Imbalanced Datasets.

The code will be updated after carrying data cleaning processes.
